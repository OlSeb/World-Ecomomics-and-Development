# World Ecomomics and Development

As someone with family on 3 different continents and who is thinking about where to settle down, I found interest in visualizing and analyzing the world map with metrics such as GDP per capita, HDI index, and life expectancy. I hope you will find this dashboard as interesting as I had fun making it!
